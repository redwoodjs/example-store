# Redwood-Stripe Example Store

Welcome to the RedwoodJS Example Store!
This repo is an example of a Redwood-Stripe integration.

This repo is the second iteration of the Redwood-Stripe project.
The first can be found in the [redwoodjs-stripe](https://github.com/chrisvdm/redwoodjs-stripe) repo.

The first was focused on integrating Redwood with Stripe from the ground up.
This presented many technical challenges, namely, how can we make Redwood as a Framework more pluggable.

This project takes the opposite approach by focusing on what a Stripe integration in a Redwood Project would look like.

The thinking is that, in the third iteration, having approached the problem from both low and high-level perspectives, we can converge on a solution.

### Use feature branches

We use feature branches that start with one of three slash prefixes:

- `feat/`â€”a brand new feature
- `bug/`â€”a bug fix
- `enhance/`â€”an improvement to an already-existing feature

Here's some examples of goodly-named branches:

- `feat/add-CONTRIBUTING.md`
